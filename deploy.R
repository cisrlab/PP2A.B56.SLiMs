#  deploy Shiny App to data-viz.it.wisc.edu
#  - if deploy the first time, need to connect via RStudio:
#    - runApp -> publish -> add account -> add server -> connect
#  - please keep rsconnect/ folder so that updated app will be deployed under
#    the same appID and url as well as saving deployment time
#
#  Results:
